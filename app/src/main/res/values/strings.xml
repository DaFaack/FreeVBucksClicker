    <string name="plottwist"><b>Well, and now?</b> \nDid you really think that you would get 10,000 V-Bucks just for pressing a button 100,000 times?\n\nFortnite Battle Royale is a free to play game and V-Bucks are the developers‘s way to make money.
So instead of trying to cheat yourself more free stuff, why don‘t you go ahead and support the developers of the game you like by buying some V-Bucks. \n\nThis app was made as a prank and to teach people a lesson about cheating your way to free content at the cost of other people.\n\nYou can now either be mad about wasting your time, leave a bad review and uninstall the app, or you can show this app to your friends in an attempt to teach them a lesson or to simply prank them. \n\nCheers.\n</string>
